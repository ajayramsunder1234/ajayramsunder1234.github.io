        <p>This chart displays the average years of education for the World and each continent from 1870 to 2020.
             The data shows trends and changes in educational attainment over time, highlighting significant increases 
             and regional disparities.</p>
        <p>From the chart, it can be seen that the average years of education in the World has increased over time. It can 
            also be seen that while some regions had major jumps in average years of education, others had less. This can be
            indicative of the development levels in these regions.
